# TODO: Improve CSS and UI/UX for Dashboard

## Plan Steps
- [x] Update `src/index.css` to add global modern styles like improved typography, subtle gradients, and better spacing.
- [x] Enhance `src/App.css` with stronger shadows, refined borders, hover effects, and color schemes for cards, navs, and main content.
- [x] Modify `src/components/shared/TopNav.js` for better visual hierarchy and interactive elements.
- [x] Modify `src/components/shared/MainNav.js` for better visual hierarchy and interactive elements.
- [x] Adjust `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.js` for improved layout, card styling, and responsiveness.
- [x] Ensure all changes promote a clean, professional UI with proper shading and borders on blocks.

## Followup Steps
- [x] Test the app locally to verify changes.
- [x] Check responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- [x] Ensure no breaking changes to functionality.
